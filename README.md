# Capstone-Project
This is the repo for my Capstone Project part of the Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree

** IMPORTANT!!! *** THE APP IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT

Here you can see some screenshots of the work I've done so far and what the final app will be about. The actual code is in a PRIVATE repo for now.

The main idea is that our best friends (talking about our dogs, of course) need to socialize with other dogs as much as their owners with other people. We always like to go for a coffee with friends, talking over dinner or going to the movies. For our four legged pets, the only opportunity to meet friends is when we take them out for a walk. And with our busy everyday schedule sometimes we tend to underestimate the need for social life of our dogs, just taking them out for a short amount of time to… you know… do their job.
 
My app aims to change this by offering the option for the user to schedule a walk (very short, short, medium or long) and invite other users to walk their dogs with him in a preselected area. If the walk is set to public, all users will be able to see it and request to join if they want. All walks can be sorted by city, dog’s breed, duration or neighbourhood.

App Features: 
* Creating and displaying a list of events (dog walks)
* Users can add one or more dogs to their pet list (and manage their profile)
* Users can choose to set the walk as private and invite only specific people to it
* Users can request to join in an already created public walk
* See a list of nearby dog playgrounds (usually in the big parks)
* Post about lost/found dogs
* Cloud sync across devices

Used technologies:
* Google Account Login
* Firebase (Authentication, Realtime Database and Storage for now)
* Firebase UI
* Google Place Picker and Maps APIs 
* and others
